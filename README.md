# Show_Dist_App
This is a script for simple Shiny App 

The ui page get as input the kind of probability distribution you want to display (F, Student's t of Chi Square) and the degrees of freedom (note that for F two DFs have to be specified, while for t and Chi Square DF2 is unused).

As result, the server.R script plots the corresponding distribution. It is possible to see how the shape of the distribution changes by changing the inputs.
